                    As with any not-for-profit organization, DRBI requires reliable sources of income to offset operational costs.  One of the earliest responses to this need was the design and construction of the Casas de Rosas.   The 16 rental apartments built around a restful courtyard allow for the perfect combination of privacy and community living while providing regular revenue to the Institute.

                    It was a vision of the Board of Directors to embody the spiritual peace of the desert in a structure where people could go to reflect, pray, meditate, or celebrate.  The final Pavilion is a beautiful round structure white concrete dome and poured columns made from concrete and crushed white stone. The pavilion was dedicated on November 27, 2004 and the picture above shows David Hadden and Marguerite Sears preparing to bury a box at the foot of the ramp containing the names of all the people who donated towards the Pavilion’s construction.

                    As activities began to ramp up at DRBI and weekend camps and retreats became more common it became apparent that more accommodation needed to be built.  The construction of the Guffey Center enabled up to 50 people to stay during sessions.  The Centre honors two of DRBI’s steadfast volunteers, Ray and Gloria Guffey.  Ray’s impact can be seen in every sidewalk and stone while Gloria continues to serve the Institute in any way she can.

                    Early residents and artists Duffy and Jeanne proposed moving DRBI one step closer to the founders’ original vision by turning the Guest House into an Art Gallery.  Using their own funds and efforts they converted what had been a two-bedroom home into an art space with room for shows, classes, a both a painting and working pottery studio.
